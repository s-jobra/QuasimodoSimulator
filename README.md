# Quasimodo Simulator
Parser for OpenQASM circuits using [Quasimodo](https://github.com/trishullab/Quasimodo) for backend.

Originally used as a parser for the [MEDUSA](https://github.com/s-jobra/MEDUSA) simulator, therefore most of it is written in C.

Assumes all non-python prerequisites are installed as stated in Quasimodo's README.
Then you can build the simulator with:
```
./config-quasimodo
make
```
